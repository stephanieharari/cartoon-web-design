<h1>The sharpei dog</h1>
<p>The Shar-Pei is a breed of dog known for its deep wrinkles and blue-black tongue.
<br>The breed originates from southern China. The English name "Shar-Pei" derives from the British spelling of the older Cantonese shā pèih (沙皮, Mandarin: shā pí), which translates to "sandy skin" and refers to the texture of the breed's short, rough coat.
<br> As puppies, Shar-Pei have numerous wrinkles, but as they mature, these loosen and spread out as they "grow into their skin". 
<br>The Shar-Pei was named in 1978 as one of the world's rarest dog breeds by TIME magazine and Guinness World Records. 
<br>Although the Shar-Pei has been identified as a basal breed that predates the emergence of the modern breeds in the 19th century, the American Kennel Club recognized it as their 134th breed only in 1992.[2][3]</p>
